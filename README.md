# Arduino Led Matrix

Here you can find schematics and code to connect a LED matrix, such as the LBT2088AH, to an Arduino.

You can also find a [character builder](https://rodrigosc.github.io/ArduinoLedMatrix/char_builder/builder.html), to design what you want to show with your LEDs.

These schematics and code are explained in the following blog posts:
